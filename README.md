# clj-fdb

    [org.jasani/clj-fdb "0.1.0"]

A Clojure client interface to FoundationDB.

This is an early release.  It is functional and includes many features
of FoundationDB including Directories, Subspaces, Tuples and encoding
of values.  The only caveat is that I'm still experimenting with the
API that I want to present.  With that caveat, please experiment with
this.  Any and all feedback is welcome.

## Usage

Example usage can be seen in `test/` and `examples/class-scheduling`.
